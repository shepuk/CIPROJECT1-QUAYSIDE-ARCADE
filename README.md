### Brief project outline (to be updated as project advances)

#### Quayside Arcade
##### A (fictional) arcade & cafe situation on Newcastle's River Tyne


##### BUG - Text not centered in call to action button, hero section. Resolved by removing parent div of <p> elememt and aligning <p> element instead.
##### BUG - .nav-link hover effect not displaying correctly when in phone/tablet dropdown state. 
##### BUG - Some horizontal scrolling sactivated once viewport is below 992px - caused by hero image media query
##### BIG - Event cards hug left of viewport when in mobile view - Resolved, issue caused by bootsrap/custom styling conflict. Altered min/max div sizes and added left/right margin with a media query to center as desired.
