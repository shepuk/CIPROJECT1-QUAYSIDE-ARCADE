# Quayside Arcade

## Live Project
[View the live project here.](Insert link here)

## Milestone Project One
- This project tasked me with creating a static website with three pages using front end technologies. Additionally, content should be justified, functional, presented logically, accessible and responsive.
- Quayside Arcade is a fictional modern arcade/bar/cafe, and a project which I have created to display and test front end abilities. HTML, CSS and Bootstrap were primarilly used, along with other tools which will be outlined in this ReadMe.
- The website consists of three main pages, with some page section link functionality also used for easier navigation. A home page gived users a quick overview of the business offerings, and returning visitors quick access to upcoming events. For customers who would like to explore further, an 'explore' page goes into greater depth of the business offerings. Finally, a contact page provides users with contact and addresss information.

-  ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   I used the color palette tool [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to find a pleasing set of colours to use in the design of the website. The main colours used are: #e63946, #ff9d9d, #a8dadc, #457b9d, #1d3557 & #212529
        - Pale colours alongside dark or bright text allowed a good level of contrast between text and images for better accessiblilty. 
    -   #### Typography
        -   Bebas Neue and Barlow Semi Condensed fonts are the main fonts used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font. These custom fonts are modern, readable and pleasing to the eye, making the website more enjoyable as a result. Fonts were imported from [Google Fonts.](https://fonts.google.com/)
        - Using a range of styling and font weights gives good variety throughout the website while only using two fonts. 
        - For navbar links, I used a subtle scale increase and brightness increase hover effect to make it obvious that the text is a link. High-contrast buttons were used elsewhere for clear navigation.
        - [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons are used throughout the website design to provide emphasis, aethstetic value and clear labeling for the user. 
    -   #### Imagery
        - Large hero images are used to catch attention and guide the user to the next webpage - naturally stepping through the user journey.
        - Other images are used throughout and act responsively. A gallery section showcases an inviting venue. Images of food and drinks acompany descriptions of a bar/cafe area for reference. 
        -   Various stock imagery has been used througout the website. I was careful to choose images which complemented the design/ font/ colour scheme of my website. Stock photos are sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

## Features

-   The website has been designed with responsiveness in mind at all times. Not only do elements responsively and dynamicly move around the page to suit different viewports, but my design is actively updated as well. For example, hero sections change to a full screen design on smaller devices and remove all margins as this looks much better on phone screens.
- The website is interactive and provides great feedback to the user. Starting with the navbar, links scale and change colour when hovered over. The navbar updates to a dropdown on smaller devices. Buttons throughout the website animate and change colour when hovered over.
- In interactive Google Map is implemented via iframe.
- The contact form animates when clicked and filled in.

### Features to implement in the future

- I would like to return to this project and add an event booking feature. This would allow users to select an event, enter their details and be enrolled in one of the advertised events. 

### Technologies / Libraries / Programs

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

## Testing

### User Stories

- **First time visitor goals**
    1. As a new visitor, I want to find information on what the venue does and what it has to offer me.
        - The business features are made immidiately apparent to the user with a short but descriptive hero section, followed by a grid list of products and services. 
        - A clean navigaton style helps the user to browse the website easilly and strong headings provide strong context. A natural flow through the website is provided by large 'call to action' buttons in the hero headings, with the goal of eventually leading the user to the booking page.
    2. As a new visitor, I want to look at images and see what it's like inside the business.
        - A gallery is provided on the home page which invites the user to see inside the building and provide visual descriptions of what they can expect when visiting.
    3. As a new visitor, I want to find out about any upcoming events to spectate or sign up.
        - A row of cards shows upcoming events clearly. This is on the home page, and also linked back to via the explore page. Booking instructions are provideed clearly underneath the event listings so that the user knows how to book if desired.
    4. As a new visitor, I would like to see menu and pricing options.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to check on upcoming events to spectate or sign up if desired.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find contact details for the organisation.

    -   #### Booked Visitor Goals

        1. As a Booked Visitor, I want to find directions to the venue.
        2. As a booked Visitor, I want to find info and pricing on food and drinks.

### Testing the code

Throughout the project, I used the W3C validator tools to find and fix various typos or errors in my code.

#### Bug examples

1. I ran into issues when trying to center some text placed inside the hero heading button. 
    - This was resolved by removing the parent div of the p element and directly center aligning the p element instead.
2. Link hover animations were not displaying correctly when the navbar was in it's collapsed moobile state. To resolve this I needed to center the links in the dropdown menu, however Bootstrap's styling made this difficult.
    - After some troubleshooting, I searched online and found a StackOverflow post detailing a similar issue. After applying the fix the animations appeared correctly.
3. In mobile views when some hero section media queries take effect, some horizontal scrolling was activated, creating unwanted overflow of the hero image, behind the scrollbar.
    - I found the fix for this to be related to my CSS styling. I altered the media query to update the hero image to 100% width rather than 100vw width to resolve this.
