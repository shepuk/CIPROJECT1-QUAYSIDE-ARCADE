# Quayside Arcade

## Live Project
[View the live project here.](Insert link here)

## Milestone Project One
- This project tasked me with creating a static website with three pages using front end technologies. Additionally, content should be justified, functional, presented logically, accessible and responsive.
- Quayside Arcade is a fictional modern arcade/bar/cafe, and a project which I have created to display and test front end abilities. HTML, CSS and Bootstrap were primarilly used, along with other tools which will be outlined in this ReadMe.
- The website consists of three main pages, with some page section link functionality also used for easier navigation. A home page gived users a quick overview of the business offerings, and returning visitors quick access to upcoming events. For customers who would like to explore further, an 'explore' page goes into greater depth of the business offerings. Finally, a contact page provides users with contact and addresss information.

-  ## Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   I used the color palette tool [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to find a pleasing set of colours to use in the design of the website. The main colours used are: #e63946, #ff9d9d, #a8dadc, #457b9d, #1d3557 & #212529
        - Pale colours alongside dark or bright text allowed a good level of contrast between text and images for better accessiblilty. 
    -   #### Typography
        -   Bebas Neue and Barlow Semi Condensed fonts are the main fonts used throughout the website with Sans Serif as the fallback font. These custom fonts are modern, readable and pleasing to the eye, making the website more enjoyable as a result. Fonts were imported from [Google Fonts.](https://fonts.google.com/)
        - Using a range of styling and font weights gives good variety throughout the website while only using two fonts. 
        - For navbar links, I used a subtle scale increase and brightness increase hover effect to make it obvious that the text is a link. High-contrast buttons were used elsewhere for clear navigation.
        - [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons are used throughout the website design to provide emphasis, aethstetic value and clear labeling for the user. 
    -   #### Imagery
        - Large hero images are used to catch attention and guide the user to the next webpage - naturally stepping through the user journey.
        - Other images are used throughout and act responsively. A gallery section showcases an inviting venue. Images of food and drinks acompany descriptions of a bar/cafe area for reference. 
        -   Various stock imagery has been used througout the website. I was careful to choose images which complemented the design/ font/ colour scheme of my website. Stock photos are sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

## Features

-   The website has been designed with responsiveness in mind at all times. Not only do elements responsively and dynamicly move around the page to suit different viewports, but my design is actively updated as well. For example, hero sections change to a full screen design on smaller devices and remove all margins as this looks much better on phone screens.
- The website is interactive and provides great feedback to the user. Starting with the navbar, links scale and change colour when hovered over. The navbar updates to a dropdown on smaller devices. Buttons throughout the website animate and change colour when hovered over.
- In interactive Google Map is implemented via iframe.
- The contact form animates when clicked and filled in.

### Features to implement in the future

- I would like to return to this project and add an event booking feature. This would allow users to select an event, enter their details and be enrolled in one of the advertised events.

## Testing

### Testing the code


The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://github.com/)
-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://github.com/)




##### BUG - Text not centered in call to action button, hero section. Resolved by removing parent div of <p> elememt and aligning <p> element instead.
##### BUG - .nav-link hover effect not displaying correctly when in phone/tablet dropdown state - resolved with stackoverflow post (link in css)
##### BUG - Some horizontal scrolling sactivated once viewport is below 992px - caused by hero image media query - used 100% rather than 100vw
##### BIG - Event cards hug left of viewport when in mobile view - Resolved, issue caused by bootsrap/custom styling conflict. Altered min/max div sizes and added left/right margin with a media query to center as desired.
